Such a pattern maintains in every entry featuring nulls in its description: again, that's the item sold. Then, the prevailing question looms, what should be done with these nulls? Well, I'm hesitant to take the conventional route of replacing them with the mode or median of the dataset, for fear of skewing my models. Further, the only useful feature these data harbor for the incumbent K-means and hierarchical clustering approaches are their \"quantity\" column—the fourth, above—but, for lack of an item or price, the context of the quantity is all but meaningless. With that ample justification behind us, I'll take the perhaps contentious, but I believe appropriate step of deleting the rows of data with nulls in their description. To further assuage doubt, this represents 1454/541911 = 0.003% of the data."

From a practical perspective, these sorts of data would either provide our models the same degree of perfect prediction that CustomerID would've—such as InvoiceNo and StockCode—or simply be confounding, overfitting-prone information—such as InvoiceDate. Then, we are left with four features—Description, Quantity, UnitPrice, and Country—to plug into our unsupervised models. As one-hot encoding has already situated Description and Country for binary classification, the only two features left to normalize are Quantity and UnitPrice, a step which is rather important given these distance-based forms of classification."
