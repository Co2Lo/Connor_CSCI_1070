1a.) Are you working alone or with someone else?
Alone.

1b.) What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project?
I'll invest 5-7 hours every weekend, beginning Saturday, April 6th, and ending Sunday, April 28th. In the first weekend, I'll perform thorough preprocessing, oversampling, and preliminary model experimentation. On the second weekend, I'll nail down which models best fit the data and how they can be visually represented in a way which rejects or fails to reject the null hypothesisâ€”all of this in functions with docstrings and type hints, of course. On the third weekend, I'll transcribe much of this raw code and the thought behind it into palatable Powerpoint slides and a Readme.md file also detailing the problem and solution approach. On the fourth and final weekend, I'll rehearse the Powerpoint slides, tune up any remaining irregularities in my model, and submit the code, Readme.md file, and Powerpoint slides, in-time for the first available presentation slot.

2.) What dataset are you going to use?
The adult "Census income" dataset available at <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult>

3.) What is your starting hypothesis about the data?
Null: For the census income dataset, there will be no difference in the population characteristics between the adults earning less than $50,000/year and the adults earning $50,000/year or more.
Alternative: For the census income dataset, there will be a difference in the population characteristics of adults earning less than $50,000/year and adults earning $50,000/year or more.

4.) What models do you plan to apply to your data first?
I plan on first applying the oversampled logistic regression and knn models to my data.
